# basic-slider
A very simple carousel/slider made with Javascript and CSS.
Just create an HTML structure like in the carousel.html file and place the content of the slide inside the div with "slide-content" class.
Configure the number of slides per view and the height of the container in the script.js file.
The styles.css files contains the basic settings to make the slider 'work' properly.
